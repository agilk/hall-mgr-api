# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Hall Manager API** - an API system for exam building supervision and management. The project requirements are documented in "Exam Building Supervision.gdoc".

## Project Status

This is a new project currently in the initial planning phase. The codebase structure has not yet been implemented.

## Technology Stack

Based on the repository configuration:
- **Platform**: Node.js (inferred from .gitignore)
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript (to be determined)
- **Type**: REST API

## Project Structure

The project structure has not yet been established. Typical structure for a Node.js API project will likely include:
- `/src` - Source code
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/docs` - API documentation

## Development Commands

*To be added once the project structure is established*

## Architecture

The architecture will be defined based on the requirements in "Exam Building Supervision.gdoc". Key considerations for an exam hall management system typically include:

- **Exam Management**: Scheduling, room allocation, capacity management
- **Building/Hall Supervision**: Tracking building usage, supervisor assignments
- **User Management**: Different roles (administrators, supervisors, proctors)
- **Reporting**: Generating reports on exam hall usage and supervision

## Environment Setup

*To be added once dependencies are established*

## Testing

*To be added once testing framework is chosen*

## API Design

*To be documented once API endpoints are defined*

## Notes

- This project is in the initial setup phase
- Core requirements are documented in the PDF specification file
- Technology choices and architecture decisions are yet to be finalized
